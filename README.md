# Full-Stack Recipe App


### Creating a RESTful web API using Node, Express and MongoDB
* running "node server" or "nodemon server" spins the Node server up correctly, serving the Express app
* each endpoint is implemented using separate middleware
* the correct HTTP methods are used in each middleware
* no CORS errors occur
* all Promise errors are caught and sent back to the client
* suitable HTTP status codes are attributed to each response


### Using Mongoose to access a MongoDB database in an Express app

* the Express app is able to correctly connect to its MongoDB Atlas cluster
* a sensible Recipe schema is built using Mongoose, including any required fields, and is exported as a model
* appropriate Mongoose methods are used properly for database access in various app routes
